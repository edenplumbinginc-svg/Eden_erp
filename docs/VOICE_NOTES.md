## API Endpoints

### POST /api/tasks/:id/voice-notes
Upload a voice note to a task.

**Auth:** Required  
**Permission:** `voice.create`  
**Content-Type:** `multipart/form-data`

**Request Body:**
```

```

**Success Response (201):**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "item": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "taskId": "uuid",
    "url": "/tmp_uploads/filename.webm",
    "durationSeconds": 45,
    "createdAt": "2025-10-28T20:00:00Z",
    "createdBy": "uuid"
  }
}
```

**Error Responses:**
- `400` - Validation error (duration > 120s)

---

### GET /api/tasks/:id/voice-notes
List all voice notes for a task.

**Auth:** Required

## Error Handling

### Microphone Permission Denied
**User sees:** "‚ùå Microphone access denied. Please allow microphone access in your browser settings."  
**Resolution:** User must grant microphone permission in browser.

### File Too Large
**User sees:** Toast notification: "‚ùå Recording too large (>5MB). Please record a shorter message."  
**Resolution:** Record a shorter message or reduce audio quality.

### Duration Exceeded
**Client:** Automatically stops recording at 2 minutes and warns user.  
**Server:** Returns 400 error if duration >120s somehow bypasses client check.

### No Microphone Found
**User sees:** "‚ùå No microphone detected. Please connect a microphone and try again."  
**Resolution:** User must connect/enable a microphone device.

### Network Errors
**User sees:** Toast notification: "‚ùå Upload failed. Please check your connection and try again."  
**Resolution:** Check network connectivity and retry.

## Feature Flag Control

### Enabling Voice Notes (Internal Only)

**File:** `apps/coordination_ui/src/config/features.json`

```json
{
  "voiceToText": true,  // ‚Üê Set to true to enable
  "hardDeleteProjects": false,
  "includeArchivedToggle": true,
  "rbacDevBanner": true
}
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** 
- Feature flag **defaults to OFF**
- Keep OFF in production unless actively testing
- Only internal admins should enable this flag
- Restart frontend workflow after changing: `npm run dev:web`

---

## Database Schema

**Table:** `task_voice_notes`

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| id | uuid | Primary key |
| task_id | uuid | Foreign key to tasks table (CASCADE DELETE) |
| file_url | text | Path to audio file (relative to server) |
| duration_seconds | integer | Duration in seconds |
| created_by | uuid | Foreign key to users table |
| created_at | timestamp | When the voice note was created |

**Indexes:**
- `idx_voice_notes_task` on `task_id` (for fast task lookups)
- `idx_voice_notes_created` on `created_at DESC` (for chronological sorting)

## Security Considerations

### RBAC Enforcement
- ‚úÖ Frontend hides controls based on permissions (UX optimization)
- ‚úÖ Backend enforces permissions on ALL endpoints (security layer)
- ‚úÖ Direct API calls without permission return 403

### File Upload Security
- ‚úÖ File size limit enforced (5MB)
- ‚úÖ MIME type validation (audio/* only)
- ‚úÖ Unique UUID filenames prevent overwrites
- ‚úÖ Files stored in tmp_uploads/ (not publicly accessible)

### Data Privacy
- ‚úÖ Voice notes tied to task (deleted if task is deleted via CASCADE)
- ‚úÖ Creator tracked (created_by field)
- ‚úÖ RBAC controls who can read voice notes

---

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't see the Record button"
**Check:**
1. Is `voiceToText` feature flag enabled?
2. Does your role have `voice.create` permission?
3. Did you restart the frontend after enabling the flag?

### "Recording doesn't start"
**Check:**
1. Did you allow microphone permission?
2. Is your microphone connected and enabled?
3. Check browser console for errors

### "Upload fails"
**Check:**
1. Is the file <5MB?
2. Is the duration <120 seconds?
3. Is the backend server running?
4. Check network connectivity

### "Voice notes don't appear"
**Check:**
1. Does your role have `voice.read` permission?
2. Are there actually voice notes attached to this task?
3. Check browser console for API errors
