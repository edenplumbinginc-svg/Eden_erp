# Testing the Release Guard - Complete Guide

This guide walks you through testing the complete CI/CD gating workflow with the Release Guard.

## Prerequisites

- ‚úÖ Escalation worker enabled in DRY_RUN mode with 10% canary
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions workflow created (`.github/workflows/deploy-canary.yml`)
- ‚úÖ Rollback script created (`scripts/rollback-staging.sh`)
- ‚úÖ Staging environment accessible

## Test 1: Verify Guard Blocks on Critical Incidents

### Step 1: Create a Blocking Incident

Create a critical incident at escalation level 1 (started 6 minutes ago, within the 10-minute lookback window):

```sql
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "
UPDATE incidents
SET status='open',
    acknowledged_at=NULL,
    severity='critical',
    escalation_level=1,
    first_seen=now() - interval '6 minutes'
WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM incidents ORDER BY random() LIMIT 1)
RETURNING id, incident_key, severity, escalation_level, first_seen;
"
```

### Step 2: Test the Release Guard Endpoint

```bash
curl -s -w "\nHTTP Status: %{http_code}\n" \
  -H "X-Guard-Lookback-Min: 10" \
  -H "X-Guard-Min-Esc-Level: 1" \
  -H "X-Guard-Include-Warning: false" \
  "https://<STAGING_HOST>/ops/release-guard" | jq
```

**Expected Response:**
```
HTTP Status: 503
{
  "pass": false,
  "violations": [...]
}
```

### Step 3: Simulate CI/CD Pipeline

Save this as `test-guard-block.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

echo "üöÄ Simulating canary deployment..."
echo "‚úÖ Tests passed"
echo "‚úÖ Build succeeded"
echo "‚úÖ Canary deployed (10%)"
echo "‚úÖ Smoke tests passed"
echo ""

echo "üõ°Ô∏è  Checking Release Guard..."

code=$(curl -s -o guard.json -w "%{http_code}" \
  -H "X-Guard-Lookback-Min: 10" \
  -H "X-Guard-Min-Esc-Level: 1" \
  "https://<STAGING_HOST>/ops/release-guard")

echo "Release Guard HTTP: $code"
cat guard.json | jq '.'

if [ "$code" = "200" ]; then
  echo ""
  echo "‚úÖ Release Guard PASSED"
  echo "‚úÖ Promoting to production (100%)..."
  echo "‚úÖ Deployment complete!"
  exit 0
else
  echo ""
  echo "‚ùå Release Guard BLOCKED"
  echo "üîÑ Executing auto-rollback..."
  ./scripts/rollback-staging.sh
  echo "‚ùå Deployment failed - blocked by active incidents"
  exit 1
fi
```

Run it:

```bash
chmod +x test-guard-block.sh
./test-guard-block.sh
```

**Expected Output:**
```
üöÄ Simulating canary deployment...
‚úÖ Tests passed
‚úÖ Build succeeded
‚úÖ Canary deployed (10%)
‚úÖ Smoke tests passed

üõ°Ô∏è  Checking Release Guard...
Release Guard HTTP: 503
{
  "pass": false,
  "violations": [...]
}

‚ùå Release Guard BLOCKED
üîÑ Executing auto-rollback...
Rolling back staging deployment...
‚úÖ Rollback completed
‚ùå Deployment failed - blocked by active incidents
```

## Test 2: Verify Guard Passes After Resolution

### Step 1: Acknowledge the Blocking Incident

```sql
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "
UPDATE incidents
SET acknowledged_at = now()
WHERE acknowledged_at IS NULL
  AND escalation_level >= 1
  AND severity = 'critical'
  AND first_seen > now() - interval '10 minutes'
RETURNING id, incident_key, acknowledged_at;
"
```

### Step 2: Rerun the Pipeline

```bash
./test-guard-block.sh
```

**Expected Output:**
```
üöÄ Simulating canary deployment...
‚úÖ Tests passed
‚úÖ Build succeeded
‚úÖ Canary deployed (10%)
‚úÖ Smoke tests passed

üõ°Ô∏è  Checking Release Guard...
Release Guard HTTP: 200
{
  "pass": true,
  "violations": []
}

‚úÖ Release Guard PASSED
‚úÖ Promoting to production (100%)...
‚úÖ Deployment complete!
```

## Test 3: GitHub Actions Integration

### Step 1: Push to Main Branch

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Release Guard to CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Monitor Workflow

Go to GitHub ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí "Canary Deployment with Release Guard"

**Expected Flow:**

1. ‚úÖ **Test** job runs
2. ‚úÖ **Build** job runs
3. ‚úÖ **Deploy Canary** job starts
   - ‚úÖ Deploy to staging (10%)
   - ‚úÖ Smoke test (health check)
   - ‚úÖ Smoke test (escalation worker)
   - üõ°Ô∏è **Release Guard** check
     - If blocking incidents: ‚ùå FAIL ‚Üí Auto-rollback
     - If clean: ‚úÖ PASS ‚Üí Continue
4. ‚úÖ **Promote Production** job runs (only if guard passed)

### Step 3: Review Artifacts

If the guard blocks deployment, check the **release-guard-report** artifact:

```
guard.json contains:
{
  "pass": false,
  "violations": [
    {
      "reason": "error_rate_critical",
      "route": "GET /api/tasks",
      "evidence": {...}
    }
  ]
}
```

## Test 4: End-to-End Automated Flow

### Scenario: Production Issue Detection

1. **Issue Occurs** ‚Üí Metrics spike ‚Üí Incident created
2. **Escalation Worker** ‚Üí Detects overdue incident ‚Üí Escalates to L1
3. **Developer Pushes** ‚Üí CI/CD pipeline starts
4. **Release Guard** ‚Üí Detects L1 incident ‚Üí Blocks deployment (HTTP 503)
5. **Auto-Rollback** ‚Üí Pipeline rolls back canary
6. **On-Call Alerted** ‚Üí Via Slack escalation notification
7. **Issue Resolved** ‚Üí Incident acknowledged
8. **Re-Deploy** ‚Üí Guard passes ‚Üí Deployment succeeds

### Timeline Simulation

```bash
# T+0: Issue starts
echo "üî• Issue detected at 00:00"

# T+5: Escalation worker escalates
echo "üìà Incident escalated to L1 at 00:05"

# T+6: Developer attempts deploy
echo "üöÄ Deploy attempted at 00:06"

# T+6: Guard blocks
echo "üõ°Ô∏è Release Guard BLOCKS at 00:06 (L1 incident active)"

# T+7: Auto-rollback
echo "üîÑ Canary rolled back at 00:07"

# T+15: Issue fixed
echo "‚úÖ Issue resolved at 00:15"

# T+16: Deploy succeeds
echo "üöÄ Deploy succeeds at 00:16 (no active incidents)"
```

## Configuration Tuning

### Adjust Guard Sensitivity

**More Strict** (block on any recent escalation):
```yaml
GUARD_LOOKBACK_MIN: 5      # Last 5 minutes only
GUARD_MIN_ESC_LEVEL: 0     # Block even at level 0
GUARD_INCLUDE_WARNING: true # Include warnings
```

**Less Strict** (only block on severe issues):
```yaml
GUARD_LOOKBACK_MIN: 20      # Last 20 minutes
GUARD_MIN_ESC_LEVEL: 3      # Only block at L3+
GUARD_INCLUDE_WARNING: false # Critical only
```

## Troubleshooting

### Guard always blocks

**Check active incidents:**
```sql
SELECT incident_key, severity, escalation_level, 
       first_seen, acknowledged_at
FROM incidents
WHERE acknowledged_at IS NULL
  AND first_seen > now() - interval '10 minutes'
ORDER BY escalation_level DESC, first_seen DESC;
```

**Quick fix (acknowledge all):**
```sql
UPDATE incidents
SET acknowledged_at = now()
WHERE acknowledged_at IS NULL;
```

### Guard never blocks (broken)

**Verify escalation worker is running:**
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3000/ops/escalation/health | jq '.enabled, .lastTickAt'
```

**Check for escalated incidents:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM incidents 
WHERE escalation_level >= 1;
```

### GitHub Actions not calling guard

**Check workflow file:**
```bash
grep -A 10 "Release Guard" .github/workflows/deploy-canary.yml
```

**Verify staging URL is set:**
```bash
# In GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets ‚Üí Actions
STAGING_URL = https://your-app.repl.co
```

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ Guard blocks deployment when critical L1+ incidents exist
‚úÖ Guard passes when no recent critical incidents
‚úÖ Auto-rollback executes on guard failure
‚úÖ guard.json artifact saved for debugging
‚úÖ GitHub Actions workflow integrates guard correctly
‚úÖ Deployment succeeds after resolving incidents

## Next Steps

Once Release Guard is verified:

1. **Tune thresholds** based on your incident patterns
2. **Add Slack notifications** on guard failures
3. **Monitor guard metrics** (block rate, false positives)
4. **Document override procedures** for emergencies
5. **Expand to production** when confident
