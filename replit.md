# Eden ERP - Project Documentation

## Overview
Eden ERP is a monolithic ERP shell for Eden Plumbing Inc., designed to streamline business operations, starting with coordination and procurement. It provides a robust backend with a defined database schema and a basic REST API, serving as a scalable platform for future application modules to efficiently manage projects, tasks, and resources.

## User Preferences
I prefer iterative development, with a focus on delivering functional increments. Please ask before making major architectural changes or introducing new dependencies. I appreciate clear and concise explanations for complex topics. Ensure the codebase remains clean, well-documented, and adheres to established patterns.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend uses React 18 with Vite, styled with 100% Google Material Design and custom CSS, emulating a professional Google Workspace aesthetic. This includes a specific color palette, typography (Roboto), an 8px spacing grid, a 4-level elevation system, and smooth transitions. A `DevAuthSwitcher` is implemented for development-time user role switching. API integration is handled via an Axios-based client. The project follows a monorepo structure with the frontend in `apps/coordination_ui/`.

### Technical Implementations
The backend is built with Express.js, Node.js 20, and uses Supabase PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM. Authentication relies on Supabase Auth with JWT verification and a comprehensive RBAC system with four roles and over 35 granular permissions, enforced via middleware and a permission-aware UI. A five-layer performance optimization stack includes localStorage caching, ETag-based conditional requests, warm-boot preloading, and a delta sync mechanism for incremental data fetching. A "realtime-lite" change beacon system uses polling to provide pseudo-realtime updates. Middleware handles Zod schema validation, rate limiting, audit logs, and idempotency. The system includes an in-app notification system, user preferences, automated overdue and idle task tracking, and auto-completion of parent tasks based on subtask status. The architecture supports future AI-powered task creation from voice and email, integrating `voiceUrl`, `voiceTranscript`, and `ballInCourtNote` fields.

### Feature Specifications
Core modules include `coordination` (projects, tasks, comments, attachments) and `procurement`. The API provides CRUD operations for Projects and Tasks, nested task creation, comment management, and specialized reporting. Server-side task filtering with pagination and sorting is supported, along with shareable URL-bound views. A unified task creation interface is available via modal or a dedicated page. Reporting features include dashboard cards and a performance leaderboard with CSV export. A guest view offers public read-only access to tasks and projects. A complete department ball handoff workflow is implemented with an audit trail and notifications. An Admin RBAC UI (`/admin/rbac`) provides email-based user lookup, direct role assignment/removal, and role template quick-apply (operations, contributor, manager, admin_full) for streamlined user management.

**Task Checklists**: Full-featured checklist system with RBAC-protected endpoints, Material Design UI, drag-and-drop reordering, optimistic updates, and 20-second delta sync. Mounted on task detail pages with permission-based controls (read/write/delete). Captures completion timestamps for performance tracking.

**Performance Events**: Micro-telemetry system that automatically logs completion metrics when checklist items are marked as done. Tracks actor, task, duration, and department for "who finishes fast" analytics. Provides foundation for badges, points, and leaderboards. Includes 3 analytical views (v_perf_fastest_week, v_perf_dept_month, v_perf_recent) for performance insights.

**Performance API**: Read-only REST endpoints exposing performance metrics for UI consumption. Three endpoints protected by authentication: `/api/perf/fastest-week` (top 20 performers this week), `/api/perf/dept-month` (department rankings last 30 days), `/api/perf/me/recent` (user's 30 most recent completions). Queries pre-computed database views for optimal performance. Ready for leaderboard UI implementation.

**Performance Leaderboard UI**: Full-featured Material Design leaderboard page at `/leaderboard` consuming Performance API endpoints. Features three main sections: (1) Top Performers This Week - top 20 fastest checklist completions with medals for top 3, (2) Department Rankings - 30-day dept performance with total completions and average time, (3) My Recent Performance - user's last 30 completions with personal stats (total, fastest, average, lightning fast count). Auto-refreshes data via React Query (60s for weekly, 120s for dept, 30s for personal). Integrates with navigation header with ⚡ emoji. Supports "WHO FINISHES FAST" gamification with badges (⚡ for <60min completions) and velocity indicators.

**Auto-Decisions v0 (Safe Rules Engine)**: Automated low-risk decision engine with full auditability. Runs every 5 minutes evaluating policies stored in `decision_policies` table. All executions logged to `decision_executions` for audit trail. Ships with 4 safe policies (all in DRY_RUN mode by default): auto-handoff from Estimation→Procurement when checklist hits 100%, idle task escalation (>7 days), speed badges for checklist items completed in <60 minutes, and unacknowledged handoff SLA escalation (48h default). Admin API (`/api/admin/decisions/*`) provides policy management, manual execution, toggle controls, and execution history. SLA thresholds are configurable via admin UI (`/admin/court-flow`) through `sla_thresholds` config table. Only enables low-risk effects: notify, create_task (templated), and label assignment.

**Ball-in-Court Analytics**: Comprehensive handoff tracking and bottleneck analysis system. `ball_in_court_events` table captures all department handoffs with acknowledgment workflow. SQL views (`v_ball_hold_time`, `v_court_flow_30d`) provide real-time metrics on hold times, acknowledgment rates, and departmental KPIs. REST API (`/api/perf/court-flow`) exposes 30-day metrics with avg/median/max hold times per department. UI components include task detail Responsibility Chain panel (15s auto-refresh, color-coded hold-time badges), Court Flow Dashboard (`/admin/court-flow`) with recharts visualizations and SLA configuration controls, and Task-level SLA Banner on task detail pages. The SLA banner shows yellow/red warnings when handoffs exceed thresholds, displays age/SLA/recipient info, and allows admins to send one-off nudge reminders directly from the task page. Supports automated SLA enforcement via decision policies.

**Monitoring & Observability**: Production-grade observability stack with full-stack Sentry error monitoring, Pino structured JSON logging, end-to-end distributed tracing, velocity metrics, robust health probes, and auto-restart resilience guards. **Backend Sentry** (configured via SENTRY_DSN and SENTRY_ENV secrets) provides crash reporting with 30% trace sampling and 10% profile sampling, Express/HTTP integrations, user context tagging, and `sentry_event_id` in error responses for incident correlation. Distributed tracing middleware emits `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers on every response when active spans exist. **Frontend Sentry** (configured via VITE_SENTRY_DSN and VITE_SENTRY_ENV secrets) initializes in `main.jsx` with browserTracingIntegration and replayIntegration (20% trace sampling, 5% session replay, 100% error replay), wrapped in ErrorBoundary with user-facing fallback. Axios interceptor propagates `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers on all API requests using active span context, enabling frontend→backend trace continuation. Combined, this delivers complete distributed tracing: browser span → API call with trace headers → backend continuation → response with trace headers. All Sentry errors are automatically tagged with `req_id` and enriched with user context (id, email) for correlation with structured logs. Request correlation IDs system generates UUID per request via middleware, sets `req.id` and `X-Request-Id` header, and propagates through all log entries. Pino logger emits structured JSON logs with service/env base fields, sensitive data redaction (auth headers, tokens, passwords), and custom serializers for HTTP requests. All logs include `req_id`, user context (`user_email`, `role`), request/response details (`method`, `url`, `statusCode`), and performance metrics (`duration_ms`, `responseTime`). Error handler logs unhandled errors with full correlation context (req_id, user info, stack trace) for end-to-end trace correlation across Sentry events and structured logs. **Health Core** provides robust DB readiness probes with background health checking (10s intervals), exponential backoff startup gate (60s timeout), and three ops endpoints: `/ops/live` (liveness probe, always returns 200 OK), `/ops/ready` (readiness probe, returns 200 READY when DB healthy, 503 NOT_READY otherwise), and `/ops/health` (detailed JSON snapshot with liveness, readiness, db status/latency, uptime, version, build_time). Legacy endpoints maintained for backward compatibility: `/healthz`, `/ready`, `/version`. The startup gate blocks server listening until DB is reachable via `waitUntilReady()` with bounded exponential backoff, preventing boot flapping. Periodic watchdog checks health every 30s via `WATCHDOG_INTERVAL_MS`, exits with code 43 after 4 consecutive failures via `WATCHDOG_FAILS_TO_EXIT`, logs recovery transitions. The `FORCE_HEALTH_FAIL=true` environment variable enables testing degraded states, forcing readiness to false and simulating DB failures without database manipulation. **Velocity Metrics Core** provides lightweight per-route telemetry with 1m/5m/15m rolling windows via `/ops/metrics` endpoint, exposing count, RPS, p50/p95 latency, and error rate for each route with Cache-Control: no-store. Auto-prunes old data points to prevent unbounded growth. **Velocity Trends** endpoint (`/ops/metrics/trends`) returns 10-second bucketed metrics over the last 5 minutes per route (30 buckets total), providing RPS, p95 latency, and error rate time-series data for sparkline visualization. Uses the 5-minute rolling window as the data source and handles empty/quiet routes with zero-filled buckets. **Velocity Dashboard UI** (`/velocity`) provides real-time operational KPIs with auto-refresh (10s), sortable table columns (Route, RPS, p50/p95 latency, Error %, Samples, Regress %), inline sparklines for p95 and RPS trends over 5 minutes, error highlighting (>5% shown in red), environment display, and authentication-protected access with ⚡ navigation link. **p95 Regression Detection** automatically compares the last 3 buckets vs previous 3 buckets from `/ops/metrics/trends`; when p95 latency increases by ≥20% AND ≥30ms absolute, a red "↑ regress XX%" badge appears in the Regress % column, enabling sorting by regression severity to identify routes experiencing performance degradation. **Sentry Correlation for Velocity Dashboard** provides one-click deep linking from Velocity metrics to filtered Sentry Discover views via `/ops/sentry-link` endpoint (requires SENTRY_ORG_SLUG and SENTRY_PROJECT_SLUG secrets). Each route row in Velocity Dashboard includes a "Sentry →" button that opens Sentry filtered to that specific route in the last hour. Backend enriches all Sentry events with per-request scope tags (route, method, status_code, duration_ms, release, build_time) set after route resolution to ensure stable route identifiers align with Velocity metrics. Transaction names use the same `routeKey()` function (e.g., "GET /api/tasks") for consistency. 5xx responses are explicitly captured with full context. Graceful fallback shows friendly alert when secrets not configured, allowing feature to ship before Sentry org/project slugs are available.

### System Design Choices
The project adopts a monolithic architecture with a scalable PostgreSQL database. It emphasizes observability through monitoring, logging, and health checks, and is designed for security with enforced authentication and multi-layered database validation. An `autosync.sh` script automates Git commits and pushes.
