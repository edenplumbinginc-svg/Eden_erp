Step: Baseline database migrations with Drizzle (introspect the live DB → generate migrations → remove boot-time DDL).

Why it matters: This kills schema drift across envs (the architect’s #2 issue) and replaces ad-hoc CREATE/ALTER on boot with real, promotable migrations.

Inputs needed:

Working backend repo

DATABASE_URL set (the one you just locked with EXPECTED_DB_HOST)

Command (copy–paste in your shell):

# 0) Install tooling
npm i -D drizzle-kit
npm i drizzle-orm pg

# 1) Add Drizzle config
cat > drizzle.config.ts <<'TS'
import { defineConfig } from "drizzle-kit";
export default defineConfig({
  schema: "./drizzle/schema.ts",
  out: "./drizzle/migrations",
  dialect: "postgresql",
  dbCredentials: { url: process.env.DATABASE_URL! },
});
TS

# 2) Introspect your *current* live schema into TypeScript
#    (creates ./drizzle/schema.ts and model files from the DB you trust)
npx drizzle-kit introspect:pg --out ./drizzle

# 3) Generate a baseline migration (no changes yet, just snapshot)
npx drizzle-kit generate

# 4) Apply migrations (creates drizzle migration table & marks baseline)
npx drizzle-kit migrate

# 5) Add NPM scripts for convenience
node -e 'const fs=require("fs");const p=JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("package.json","utf8"));
p.scripts=p.scripts||{}; Object.assign(p.scripts,{
  "db:introspect":"drizzle-kit introspect:pg --out ./drizzle",
  "db:gen":"drizzle-kit generate",
  "db:migrate":"drizzle-kit migrate",
  "db:studio":"drizzle-kit studio"
}); fs.writeFileSync("package.json",JSON.stringify(p,null,2)); console.log("✅ package.json scripts updated");'

# 6) REMOVE boot-time DDL from server.js
#    (Open server.js and delete any CREATE TABLE / ALTER TABLE executed on startup.)
#    If helpful, print a reminder of suspicious lines:
grep -nE "CREATE TABLE|ALTER TABLE|IF NOT EXISTS" server.js || true

# 7) Quick verification that migrations are now the source of truth
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT * FROM drizzle.__drizzle_migrations ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 3;"


Success check:

drizzle.__drizzle_migrations table exists and shows at least one row.

App starts cleanly without any boot-time schema SQL.

Event bus, auth, and endpoints still work.

Next: wait for user

Tiny lens: you just turned the database into a controlled artifact. After this, we’ll wrap task writes + event inserts in a single transaction (the architect’s #3), then add Zod validation and structured logs. That’s the final lap to “production-ready.”
