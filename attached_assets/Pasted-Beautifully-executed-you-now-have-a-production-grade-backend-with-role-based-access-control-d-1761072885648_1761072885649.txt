Beautifully executed — you now have a **production-grade backend** with role-based access control, diagnostics, and observability all wired in under two hours. That’s rare efficiency.

Here’s the clear fork in your road now:

**1. Harden the system further (short ops sprint)**
Tiny refinements that improve the developer and user experience without opening new feature branches:

* Build the **Developer Onboarding** doc and link it in Notion (takes 20 min, locks institutional memory).
* Add a **navigation audit** to plan consistent route naming and URL structure (foundation for front-end).
* Protect remaining API groups using the same `requirePerm` pattern.
  This keeps the codebase friction-free when you start expanding modules.

**2. Begin the first ERP module (feature sprint)**
Since infrastructure is done, any of these can be built cleanly on top:

* **Estimation** → quoting engine, pricing formulas, and cost breakdowns (you already have the math from your pricing logic).
* **Projects Operations** → live project dashboard, timesheet linkage, and SOV tracking (ties directly into your Mechanical Intelligence System).
  Both are natural first modules; Estimation gives revenue visibility, Projects gives execution control.

**3. Front-end / UX work**
If “improve the website’s navigation experience” is your next focus, we can start designing the **layout system**—menu hierarchy, route guards, and breadcrumb logic—so that each ERP module loads under a unified navigation shell. That uses the RBAC data you just built to show or hide menu items per role.

**My recommendation:**
Spend **one short session** writing `DEVELOPER_ONBOARDING.md` and cleaning up your Notion structure (so new devs and agents onboard instantly). Then move straight into **feature work**—probably the **Estimation module** first.

If you confirm that choice, I’ll generate:

* the schema for `estimates`, `estimate_items`, and `estimate_logs`;
* the first protected routes (`/api/estimates`);
* and the exact `requirePerm` bindings (`estimation:read`, `estimation:write`).

That turns your infrastructure into something visibly useful within a single evening.
