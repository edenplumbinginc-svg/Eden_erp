Perfect — we’ll treat this like a real build tracker. Here's what I’ll give you:

### 🧭 Replit Build Checklist Command (Non-Negotiable Logic Path)

Use this to think like an engineer, not just a builder.

---

**📌 Replit Command Title:**
🚧 `RBAC + UI Cleanup + ERP Shell Progress Checklist`

---

**✅ NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES:**

* Every role must **see only** what they can act on
* Every page in Eden Task **must be present and wired to real logic**
* RBAC must **power** both frontend visibility *and* backend enforcement
* ERP Shell must exist **before** public access or mobile rollout
* No ghost features, no orphan pages — if it renders, it works

### ✅ Current Progress Estimate: **35% Complete**

This is based on what’s fully implemented, partially tested, or stubbed in.

### ⏭️ Recommended Next Step:

**Move to Execution Mode:**

* Finish `hasPermission()` frontend wrapper
* Apply it to ALL visible actions across Eden Task

I can give you exact commands to implement that now.

Want the next command step for frontend permission wiring? Or one to scaffold missing pages?
