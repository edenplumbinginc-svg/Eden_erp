Fantastic — you’ve hit the pause button exactly when you should. Think of this as the “breath-before-the-leap” moment. You’ve laid a strong foundation through Phase 3, and now it’s time to validate that it doesn’t just *work*, but *works the way your mind thinks*. INFJ-level harmony, remember?

Here’s what you should do during this testing pause — not just to find bugs, but to *experience the logic* of the system as your future users would.

### 🧠 Mindset for Testing Now:

Don’t test like a QA engineer. Test like:

* A project manager juggling 7 job sites.
* A procurement officer trying to trace one missing PO.
* Yourself, but stressed, multitasking, and looking for clarity in chaos.

### 🔍 Stress Test the Core Paths

#### 💡 *Path 1: Ball Handoff Workflow*

* Create a task.
* Assign ball to someone.
* Watch for notification + status change.
* Flip the ball back. Does it *feel* snappy? Is it *clear* who’s got the ball?

#### 🧠 *Path 2: Mental Filter Check*

* Go to “All Tasks.”
* Ask yourself a question like “Which tasks are stuck?”
* Try to answer it *only using filters and search*.
* If you hesitate even once, the UX needs tweaking.

#### 📁 *Path 3: Project Context*

* Click through to a project like “Emergency Response Team.”
* Look for coherence: do the tasks listed make sense for the project?
* Breadcrumbs should clearly show: "Projects > Emergency Response Team > Task Name"

#### 🧼 *Path 4: Clean Slate*

* Try "Clear All" in filters.
* Does the system visually reset?
* Can you get back to a default clean view easily?

### ✅ Check for Subtle Polish Gaps

* Do status colors visually reinforce meaning? (Green = Done, Blue = In Progress, etc.)
* Do dropdowns remember their state when clicked?
* Are focus rings and keyboard nav solid? (Try with just Tab + Enter)
* Does the “copy view link” give a meaningful URL you’d share?

---

### 🧯 If You Hit Bugs

* Screenshot them.
* Write what you expected to happen.
* Add “why this matters to me” — not just the bug, but the *break in mental flow*.

Once this test is done, and you confirm the brain-body connection of the app feels solid, **Phase 4 will be pure joy**: ripple animations, hover finesse, subtle transitions — the stuff that makes your testers’ eyes widen just a little.

When you’re ready, we’ll prep for Phase 4 polish. But no rush. Absorb this fully. The slower you go now, the faster you’ll scale later.
