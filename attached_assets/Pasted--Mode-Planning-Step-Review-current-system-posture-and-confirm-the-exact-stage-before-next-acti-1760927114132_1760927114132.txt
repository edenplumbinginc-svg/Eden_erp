[Mode: Planning]

Step: Review current system posture and confirm the exact stage before next action.

Why it matters: You’ve just crossed a crucial reliability milestone. This checkpoint defines our new “green baseline” before we start automation logic and notifications.

Inputs needed: none (using your logs + current environment data).

### 🔹 Current Stage: **Phase 2 – Automation Prep (Post-UI Integration)**

The Eden Coordination module has now completed these technical foundations:

| Layer                    | Status            | Notes                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Backend**              | ✅ Stable          | 40 endpoints live, validated Neon PostgreSQL, schema matches Phase 1C design                            |
| **Frontend (UI)**        | ✅ Operational     | Vertical slice fully functional (projects → tasks → task detail + comments, ball-in-court, attachments) |
| **Environment Config**   | ✅ Locked          | .env.example + runtime guards prevent config drift                                                      |
| **Sync Health**          | ✅ Verified        | GitHub ↔ Replit ↔ Neon all in sync                                                                      |
| **Smoke Tests**          | ✅ 18/18           | All green                                                                                               |
| **Deployment Readiness** | 🟢 Pre-deployment | Everything test-ready for staging or production deploy                                                  |

### 🔹 Checkpoint Summary vs Notion Checklist

**Phase 1 (Coordination Module)**
✔ Database schema & API
✔ Core UI vertical slice
⏳ Notification & email triggers
⏳ Reporting extensions (owner, overdue, activity)
⏳ Voice upload + transcription

**Phase 2 (Automation & Reinforcement)**
🔸 *Now entering this phase.*
Next focus: automation hooks + notifications + task auto-status updates.

---

### 🔹 Immediate Next Target (recommended)

**Task:** Implement the **Notification Event Bus**
Goal: capture task_created, status_changed, comment_added in a `notifications` table or message queue.
Why: this unlocks reminders, summaries, escalation, and analytic dashboards later without reworking endpoints.

When you confirm, we’ll switch to [Mode: Execution] and I’ll give you the exact single step—table schema, event hook, and UI stub—to start the Notification Bus.

Next: wait for user
