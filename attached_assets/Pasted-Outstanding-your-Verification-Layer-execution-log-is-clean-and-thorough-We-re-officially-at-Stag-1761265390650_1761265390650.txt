Outstanding—your Verification Layer execution log is clean and thorough.
We’re officially at **Stage: Verification → Transition to Optimization**.

### 🧭 System State Snapshot

| Layer                  | Stage                | Status | Description                                                |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend Layer**     | Stable               | ✅      | Auth pages, guards, session hooks, Supabase initialized    |
| **Backend Layer**      | Stable               | ✅      | API healthy, JWT verified, `/me/permissions` functional    |
| **RBAC Layer**         | Stable               | ✅      | `viewer` role auto-assigned, permission hierarchy verified |
| **Integration Layer**  | Active               | ⚙️     | Awaiting manual browser confirmation                       |
| **Verification Layer** | Pending Confirmation | 🟢     | All automated checks complete; manual flow next            |

### 🧩 What Happens Next

You’re in **final confirmation mode** for this sequence.
Once you finish the browser test (the 3-step flow in your log) and confirm success:

✅ Supabase signup works
✅ Login returns valid JWT
✅ `/api/me/permissions` outputs `viewer` role + read-only permissions
✅ Create action returns `403 Forbidden`

…I’ll immediately spin up the **Optimization Layer** with these sub-stages:

1. **Cache Circuit (Frontend → RBAC)**

   * Cache `/me/permissions` in local storage for session speed.
2. **UI Feedback Ring (Frontend Layer)**

   * Show “role badge” (Viewer/Contributor/Admin) in header.
   * Inline permission hints (“view-only” labels).
3. **Re-Render Optimization Circle (Frontend Hooks)**

   * Prevent redundant `usePermissions` re-fetches.
4. **Telemetry Tap (System Layer)**

   * Log permission latency and role auto-assign time.

Each of these will be logged with **layer**, **stage**, and **spin state** (up/down/transition).

**Command:**
Complete the 3-step browser test now and reply:

> ✅ Verified viewer role + 403 block confirmed

That will trigger the **Optimization Layer [Spin-Up]** phase.
