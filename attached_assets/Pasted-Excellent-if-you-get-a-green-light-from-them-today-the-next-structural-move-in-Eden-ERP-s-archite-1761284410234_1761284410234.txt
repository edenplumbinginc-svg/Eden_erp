Excellent — if you get a green light from them today, the next structural move in Eden ERP’s architecture sequence is clear.
We’re no longer in *optimization* mode — we’re crossing into *governance* and *product structure*.

---

### 🧩 **Next Structural Phase: Governance & Product Layer [Spin-Up → Modify]**

**Objective:** move from building isolated modules (Tasks, RBAC, Delta Sync) to a **coordinated system of systems** — where roles, modules, and data flows are governed through unified metadata rather than hard-coded logic.
This is the “ERP Intelligence Spine.”

### 🧠 **Core Build Sequence (post-approval)**

#### 1. **Audit & Event Logging Layer (RBAC + Ops)**

* Create a persistent table: `audit_log (id, actor_id, action, target, payload, timestamp)`.
* Each major mutation (role change, task update, project edit) writes an entry.
* Hook existing endpoints into this writer.
* Outcome: compliance trail + foundation for activity feed.

#### 2. **Unified Module Registry**

* Build a small registry table or JSON map describing every module:

  ```json
  {
    "tasks": { "slug": "tasks", "table": "tasks", "roles": ["ops","viewer"] },
    "projects": { "slug": "projects", "table": "projects", "roles": ["pm","viewer"] }
  }
  ```
* UI reads from registry to generate navigation dynamically.
* Outcome: adding a new ERP module no longer requires code edits in multiple places.

#### 3. **Product Inventory Module (your next target)**

* Begin building `/api/products` + `/products` UI page:

  * Follows the same delta-sync + warm-boot pattern.
  * Fields: `id, sku, name, category, stock, unit_cost, updated_at`.
  * Uses existing permission structure (`inventory:read`, `inventory:edit`).
* Outcome: first *domain* module under the ERP spine, not a utility module.

#### 4. **System Intelligence Loop (Data → Insight)**

* Add a daily summary job that aggregates audit logs + usage data:

  * “Top actions by user,” “most edited module,” “avg sync latency.”
* Output JSON → feed the future dashboard.
* Outcome: early version of Eden’s “Cognitive Layer.”

### ⚙️ **Expected Layer States After Approval**

| Layer              | Stage   | Intent                         |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------ |
| RBAC Admin         | Stable  | Role controls validated        |
| Audit Layer        | Spin-Up | Record all changes             |
| Module Registry    | Spin-Up | Central definition of features |
| Product Module     | Spin-Up | Begin domain expansion         |
| Intelligence Layer | Observe | Learn from usage telemetry     |

When you receive the “green” from them, I’ll trigger **Phase 7 – Governance Boot**, starting with the Audit/Event Log implementation (Layer: Backend → System Governance).

That will formally mark the transition from *ERP Prototype* → *ERP Platform*.
