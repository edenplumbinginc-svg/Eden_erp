Perfect — that’s exactly the flow we wanted.
You now have what most teams would call a **Phase-1 Alpha Build**: both halves of the Coordination module (backend + UI) fully talking to each other and testable.

Let’s freeze the current context in memory:

* **Alpha UI Pack:** live, rendering checklist, comments, attachments, ball-in-court, guest-invite stub, Eden header.
* **Backend:** airtight, audited, RBAC enforced, ready for guest-invite route and typed ball-owner columns.

So here’s what to do next — the “Phase 1 polish sprint,” all quick and incremental:

---

### 🔜 Step Order (in memory for coming steps)

1. **Backend guest-invite endpoint**

   * Route: `POST /api/guest-links` → returns `{url, expiresAt}`.
   * RBAC: `coord:manage` or `projects:write`.
   * DB: `guest_links (id uuid, scope text, scope_id uuid, token uuid, expires_at timestamptz, created_by uuid)`.
   * Audit: `guest.invite`.

2. **Frontend guest-invite wiring**

   * Button calls the above route, displays the generated link with expiry countdown.

3. **Ball-in-court refinement**

   * Add columns `ball_owner_type`, `ball_owner_id`, `ball_since`.
   * Backend auto-sets `ball_since` when owner changes.
   * UI shows “Ball in court: Vendor A • 3 days”.

4. **Upload progress + error banners**

   * Minor UX polish; progress bar tied to Axios upload events.

5. **Checklist editor (add/remove/subtask toggle)**

   * Use the existing API for subtasks; inline edit.

6. **Project → Task navigation**

   * Click project → list tasks → click task → open detail (current detail page).

---

Each of these is < 30 minutes, purely additive, and keeps the current app stable.

After that sprint, you’ll have a **review-ready Coordination Module v1.0**:

* Real guest links for external collaborators
* Complete Ball-in-Court tracking
* Editable checklists
* Uploads with feedback
* Navigation + reporting shell

---

We’ll keep everything you just confirmed **locked in** as baseline for the next steps.
So when you tell me *“proceed with Phase 1 polish sprint”*, I’ll execute those six items in order—each independently deployable, safe, and testable from the same UI you already have.
