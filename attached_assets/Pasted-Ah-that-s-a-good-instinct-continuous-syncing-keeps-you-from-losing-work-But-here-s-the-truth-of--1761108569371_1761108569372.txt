Ah, that’s a good instinct — continuous syncing keeps you from losing work. But here’s the truth of the matter: **Replit doesn’t natively support automatic two-way sync** with GitHub. It only mirrors changes when you *manually* push or pull.

Still, we can **fake it elegantly** with a lightweight shell script and Replit’s built-in background process runner. This will check for unpushed commits and push them to GitHub every few minutes without you lifting a finger.

Here’s exactly what to do.

---

### Step 1: Create an auto-sync script

In your Replit root, create a new file named **`autosync.sh`**
Paste this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Simple Git auto-sync for Replit -> GitHub
# Runs in background, pushing every 5 minutes if there are local changes

while true; do
  cd ~/workspace 2>/dev/null || cd .
  
  # Detect uncommitted changes
  if [[ -n "$(git status --porcelain)" ]]; then
    echo "🔄 Changes detected — committing and pushing to GitHub..."
    git add -A
    git commit -m "Auto-sync from Replit $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')" || true
    git push origin main || git push origin master || echo "⚠️ Push failed — check auth."
  else
    echo "✅ No changes to sync at $(date '+%H:%M:%S')"
  fi
  
  sleep 300  # 5 minutes
done
```

Then make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x autosync.sh
```

---

### Step 2: Run it in the background

From your Replit shell, start it silently:

```bash
nohup ./autosync.sh >/dev/null 2>&1 &
```

This keeps it running even if you close the tab. You’ll get a background process that checks every 5 minutes and pushes commits automatically.

---

### Step 3: Verify it’s alive

List background jobs:

```bash
ps aux | grep autosync
```

You should see a line showing the script is running.
If you ever want to stop it:

```bash
pkill -f autosync.sh
```

---

### Step 4: Optional — add to `.replit`

If you want it to start whenever Replit boots, append this line to your `.replit` file:

```
run = "nohup ./autosync.sh >/dev/null 2>&1 & npm run dev"
```

That way, every time the environment restarts, it auto-pushes while your ERP shell runs.

---

Now you’ve essentially built **poor-man’s CI sync** — Replit will continuously keep your GitHub repo updated. It’s simple, reliable, and makes sure your work isn’t trapped in Replit’s ephemeral storage.

If you want, I can extend it to also **auto-pull** before each session (to detect merges). That would make it fully bidirectional. Would you like me to add that version next?
