Decided on workflow conflict resolution (8 seconds)
🚨 You're Stuck in a Rebase - Let's Get Unstuck
You hit two issues:

⚠️ Interactive rebase in progress
⚠️ PAT scope limitation (can't push workflow files)
🔧 Quick Fix - Abort Rebase & Different Approach:
# 1. Abort the rebase to get back to clean state
git rebase --abort
# 2. Get back to a clean main
git checkout main
git fetch origin
# 3. Reset to match GitHub exactly
git reset --hard origin/main
# 4. Now create a NEW commit with JUST the checker fix
git add scripts/check-ui-coverage.js
git commit -m "fix(ci): handle multi-part routes in UI coverage checker"
# 5. Push ONLY the checker fix (no workflow file)
git push origin main
🎯 Why This Works:
✅ Workflow file stays on GitHub (you already uploaded it manually)
✅ Checker fix goes through (no workflow scope needed for scripts/ folder)
✅ No rebase conflicts
✅ CI will re-run with the fix
⚡ After You Push:
Within 10 seconds:

✅ GitHub Actions triggers new Quality Gates run
✅ UI coverage passes (finds /about/eden)
✅ Remaining gates execute
Run those commands and let me know! 🚀
