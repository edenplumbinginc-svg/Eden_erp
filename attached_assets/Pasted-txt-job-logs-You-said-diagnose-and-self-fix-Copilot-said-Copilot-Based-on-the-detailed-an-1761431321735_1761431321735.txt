Based on the detailed analysis of your job-logs.txt file, here's a comprehensive diagnosis and self-fix guide for the issues encountered during your CI/CD pipeline run for the Eden_erp project:

‚úÖ Diagnosis Summary
Your GitHub Actions workflow executed successfully in terms of setup, dependency installation, and build. However, the Playwright smoke tests failed across nearly all UI routes due to:

1. Network Failures
Error: net::ERR_ABORTED
Cause: Backend API endpoints were unreachable during test execution.
Affected Routes: /dashboard, /guest, /incidents, /profile, /project/123, etc.
Endpoints: /api/me/permissions, /api/tasks, /api/projects, etc.
2. JavaScript/React Errors
Error: TypeError: s.defaultQueryOptions is not a function
Cause: Likely due to outdated or misconfigured frontend dependencies.
Affected Routes: /admin/court-flow, /admin/rbac, /audit-log, etc.
3. Console Errors
Error: Multiple 500 Internal Server Error messages.
Cause: Backend services were either down or misconfigured.
Affected Routes: /login, /signup, /reports, etc.
4. UI Visibility Failures
Error: Locator failed to find visible element within 5000ms
Cause: DOM elements not rendered due to JS errors or missing data.
Affected Routes: /guest, /task/123, /projects-delta, etc.
üõ†Ô∏è Self-Fix Guide
Step 1: Backend Availability
Ensure your backend services (API, database, auth) are running and accessible during CI.
If using mock servers or stubs, verify they are properly initialized before tests run.
Step 2: Fix JS/React Errors
Investigate the error: s.defaultQueryOptions is not a function
Likely caused by incorrect import or version mismatch in React Query or related libraries.
Fix: Check your package.json and ensure compatibility between @tanstack/react-query and other dependencies.
Step 3: Address Console Errors
Review the console error logs from Playwright artifacts (screenshots, trace files).
Common issues:
API endpoints returning 500 errors.
Missing environment variables or misconfigured API base URLs.
Fix:
Validate .env or CI secrets (e.g., VITE_SUPABASE_URL, VITE_SENTRY_DSN).
Ensure backend endpoints are reachable from the CI environment.
Step 4: Optimize Chunk Sizes
Warning: Some JS chunks exceed 500 kB.
Fix:
Use dynamic import() to split large modules.
Configure build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks in vite.config.js.
Step 5: Improve Test Resilience
Consider adding graceful fallbacks in your frontend for failed API calls.
Use mock data or service virtualization during CI to simulate backend responses.
Step 6: Run npm audit fix
4 moderate vulnerabilities detected.
Fix: Run npm audit fix --force to patch known issues.
