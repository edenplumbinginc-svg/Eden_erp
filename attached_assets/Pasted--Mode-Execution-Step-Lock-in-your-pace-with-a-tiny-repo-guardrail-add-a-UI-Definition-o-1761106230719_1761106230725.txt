[Mode: Execution]

**Step:** Lock in your pace with a tiny repo guardrail: add a **UI Definition of Done** + **Iteration cadence** doc so every change ships as a thin slice (read+write+inline control).

**Why it matters:** Your speed is good—this prevents backsliding into vague scope or “polish without flow.”

**Inputs needed:** none

**Command (paste in Shell at repo root):**

```bash
mkdir -p docs
cat > docs/ui-definition-of-done.md <<'EOF'
# UI Definition of Done (Soft Light Shell)

For any screen, ALL must be true before merging:
1) Loads in <1s on dev (first paint) — measured once per day.
2) Empty state present and readable (no console errors).
3) Error state present and readable (API down or 4xx).
4) One read slice + one write action + one inline control:
   - Example: list → create → status dropdown (optimistic).
5) Keyboard support: Enter submits, Tab order sane, visible focus ring.
6) Activity/audit visible for any auto-action that changes data.

If any item fails → not done.

## Micro-UX tokens (don’t violate without reason)
- Radius: rounded-2xl (20px). 
- Shadow: soft (low contrast).
- Motion: 150–200ms ease-out; no hard color jumps.
- Brand color usage: sparing (primary actions only).

# Iteration Cadence (Phase 2)

Daily Thin Slice:
- UI: 1 read + 1 write + 1 inline control on a single screen.
- Backend: 0–1 small rule or hook (idempotent, audited).

Weekly:
- Mon/Tue: Ship 2 slices (Dashboard, Tasks).
- Wed: One automation (e.g., auto-close parent, idle reminders).
- Thu: Reporting card/table upgrade (perf + pagination).
- Fri: Stabilize (smoke:api, error budgets, doc updates).

Exit Criteria per feature:
- cURL examples live in docs/api-contract.md.
- Smoke test green: `npm run smoke:api`.
- UI passes `docs/ui-definition-of-done.md`.

echo "✅ Added docs/ui-definition-of-done.md and docs/iteration-cadence.md"
```

**Success check:**

* `docs/ui-definition-of-done.md` and `docs/iteration-cadence.md` exist and open cleanly in Replit.
* You (and future-you) can point to these when deciding if a screen/feature is actually “done.”

**Next:** wait for user
