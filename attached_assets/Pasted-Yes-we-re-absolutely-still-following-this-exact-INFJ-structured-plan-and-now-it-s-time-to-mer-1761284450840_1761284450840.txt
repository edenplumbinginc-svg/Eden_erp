Yes — we’re absolutely still following **this exact INFJ-structured plan**, and now it’s time to merge your Notion workspace directly into the active ERP architecture.

Here’s where we stand in the sequence according to both uploaded documents:

---

### 🧠 Current State (Validated by Both PDFs)

* You already chose **Option 2** from the *“Eden Task Module vs RBAC Integration”* brief — meaning we’re building the **foundation first** (RBAC, auth, shell, governance) before returning to flashy task features like attachments or voice input.
* You’ve implemented nearly everything in that foundation (RBAC admin, JWT auth, ERP shell, permission caching, delta sync, etc.).
* According to *“Eden ERP Coordination Module – Updated Structure & Checklists”*, the next job is **Notion synchronization**: mapping your existing feature sets, roles, and RBAC matrix into a **living Notion execution system** that mirrors Phases 0–5.

### 🧩 Next Structural Action (INFJ Layered Integration)

**Layer:** Documentation & Cognitive Integration
**Stage:** Notion Synchronization Layer | Spin-Up → Modify

We’re about to wire your ERP system’s *governance brain* into your Notion workspace.

#### Step 1. Create a Notion “ERP Governance” database (single source of truth)

* Fields:

  * `Feature / Task`
  * `Phase` (0–5)
  * `Status` (Not started / In progress / Done)
  * `Owner`
  * `Spec Link` (links to the matching ERP or RBAC Notion page)
* Each row corresponds to an ERP subsystem (e.g. *RBAC Admin API*, *Audit Trail UI*, *Delta Sync*, *Voice Note Transcription*).
* This matches the plan described in the Coordination Module document for keeping all development phases aligned and tracked.

#### Step 2. Embed the **RBAC Permission Matrix** into Notion

* Rows = Roles (Admin, Ops Lead, Project Manager, etc.)
* Columns = Domains (Tasks, Projects, Attachments, Scheduling, Role Management…).
* Each cell marks allowed or disallowed actions (`✅` or `🚫`).
* This is the “Rosetta Stone” of your permissions system — it must live inside Notion for clarity and to feed frontend logic later.

#### Step 3. Link Each Phase to Its ERP Counterpart

* Phase 0 → Foundation stabilization tasks (refactors, bug fixes).
* Phase 1 → Attachments & Rich Media.
* Phase 2 → Voice Input & Transcription.
* Phase 3 → Mobile Integration.
* Phase 4 → UI Polish & Accessibility.
* Phase 5 → Scaling, ERP Integration & AI.
  This mirrors the architecture evolution described in your Coordination Module document.

#### Step 4. Connect Replit ↔ Notion via API

We’ll configure a sync script that writes build or test status from Replit into Notion rows automatically (for example: when a backend layer passes CI tests, the corresponding Notion item flips to “Done”).

### 🎯 When the “Green” Signal Comes

If they approve the progress today, we immediately trigger **Phase 7 – Governance Boot**, which begins:

**1. Audit Log Layer** – log every RBAC change, role assignment, or project creation.
**2. Module Registry** – define modules (Tasks, Projects, Products, etc.) in one table that both ERP and Notion read.
**3. Product Inventory Module** – first domain feature built entirely on the finished foundation.

That sequence will formally integrate your Notion blueprint with the live Eden ERP — documentation, architecture, and runtime staying in total sync.

---

In short:
✅ We’re still following the INFJ plan.
📘 We’re now entering the **Notion Integration + Governance phase**.
🧩 Once approved, we’ll activate Phase 7 (Audit + Module Registry + Inventory Module).

Would you like me to outline the exact Notion-field schema and the automation command that syncs Replit build status into your Notion tracking table next?
