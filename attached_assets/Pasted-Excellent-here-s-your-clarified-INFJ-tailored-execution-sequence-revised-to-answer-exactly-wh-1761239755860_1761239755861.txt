Excellent ‚Äî here‚Äôs your clarified **INFJ-tailored execution sequence**, revised to answer exactly where your RBAC model fits and what comes first.

### üß≠ Updated: My INFJ-Aligned Recommendation (with RBAC placement)

---

#### ‚úÖ Step 1: **Fix Eden Task UI First**

**Why:** The UI must reflect what roles *can* and *cannot* do ‚Äî or your RBAC logic will feel broken even if it's perfect.

**What to do now:**

* Remove DevAuthSwitcher *visually* (keep in code for testing)
* Add permission-aware components (buttons only show if user has permission)
* Hide or reword actions that don‚Äôt apply to the current role
* Clean up dummy/test views, confusing modals, or leftover dev scaffolding

**RBAC usage:** Use your `mockCurrentUser` role + permission array from the RBAC matrix to drive what appears on screen.

---

#### ‚úÖ Step 2: **Wire the Full RBAC System Into Eden Task**

**Why:** Now that the UI behaves like a real app, you can embed real role logic safely.

**What to do:**

* Use the permission matrix and `role_permissions` seeds
* Build middleware + `hasPermission()` frontend hooks
* Simulate each role using DevAuthSwitcher or fake user contexts
* Confirm: Each role can only do what they should ‚Äî nothing more

**RBAC usage:** All RBAC logic is now live inside Eden Task, but using mock or static session data.

---

#### ‚úÖ Step 3: **Build ERP Shell + Supabase Auth (Then Plug RBAC Into It)**

**Why:** Now that everything *works*, you just need to route it through a real login.

**What to do:**

* Create ERP shell app
* Add Supabase auth (email/password)
* On login: load `user.role_id` and fetch their permissions
* Store in context ‚Üí Eden Task reads that context
* Swap out DevAuthSwitcher for real user sessions

**RBAC usage:** RBAC is already tested ‚Äî now it‚Äôs just fetching from the real user, not mock.

---

#### üõë Important: **Do NOT bind RBAC directly to Supabase or the shell yet**

* You're still in active feature development
* Use static/mock permission sets for now
* Once tested, Supabase will just *pass you the keys*

---

### üîê Summary: Where RBAC Comes In

* **Step 1:** You use RBAC to **guide UI cleanup**
* **Step 2:** You use RBAC to **power real logic with mock data**
* **Step 3:** You plug real user login into the existing RBAC engine

This gives you speed **and** structure ‚Äî the INFJ paradox, solved.

Want the UI Cleanup Checklist next? Or a mock `hasPermission()` hook to drop in?
