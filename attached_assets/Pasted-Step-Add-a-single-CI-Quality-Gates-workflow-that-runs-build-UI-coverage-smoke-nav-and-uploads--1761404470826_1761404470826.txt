Step: Add a single CI Quality Gates workflow that runs build → UI coverage → smoke nav, and uploads reports.

Why it matters: You already hit 100% locally; this enforces it on every PR and keeps receipts (HTML reports, gaps).

Inputs needed:

GitHub repo with Actions enabled

Existing scripts: build, check:ui, test:smoke (done)

Command (copy–paste):

# Create CI workflow
mkdir -p .github/workflows

cat > .github/workflows/quality-gates.yml <<'YAML'
name: Quality Gates

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]

jobs:
  gates:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    permissions:
      contents: read

    steps:
      - name: Checkout

        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:

          path: coverage/playwright-report

      - name: Upload UI gaps (if any)
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4

YAML


Success check:

Open a PR → the Quality Gates job runs and must pass: build ✅, check:ui ✅, test:smoke ✅.

Artifacts show up under the run: playwright-report (HTML) and ui-gaps (if failures).

Next: wait for user.
