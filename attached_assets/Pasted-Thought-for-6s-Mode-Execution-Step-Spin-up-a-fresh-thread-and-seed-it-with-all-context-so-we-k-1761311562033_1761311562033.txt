[Mode: Execution]

Step: Spin up a fresh thread and seed it with all context so we keep momentum (and stop hitting message limits).

Why it matters: A clean thread preserves velocity and avoids losing critical decisions, policies, and URLs. You’ll have a crisp handoff point for the next build steps.

Inputs needed:

Replit link (already: https://replit.com/join/zagabiqjvq-edenplumbinginc)

Notion governance pages (RBAC, Checklists, Master Plan)

Any GitHub mirror link (if applicable)

Command (paste this as the very first message in the new thread):

Title: Eden — Auto-Decisions v0 + Performance API (Phase 7/8 Continuation)

Context Snapshot (carry-over):
- Supabase Auth ✅ | Viewer auto-assign ✅
- RBAC Admin API ✅ (assign/remove roles)
- Perf Telemetry ✅ (performance_events + views)
- Performance API ✅ (/api/perf/fastest-week, /api/perf/dept-month, /api/perf/me/recent)
- Decisions Engine v0 ✅ (dry-run by default; handoff, idle-escalate, lightning-fast badge)
- Delta Sync ✅ (Tasks + Projects), ETag ✅, Warm-Boot ✅
- Checklists ✅ (full RBAC + audit + timestamps)

Links:
- Replit: https://replit.com/join/zagabiqjvq-edenplumbinginc

Layer/Stage Telemetry (at thread start):

- Perf Telemetry: Stable ✅
- Perf API: Stable ✅
- Auto-Decisions v0: Enabled ✅ (all policies DRY_RUN=true)
- UI Leaderboard: Pending ⏳

Immediate Objectives (Execution Mode):
1) Leaderboard UI (consume /api/perf/*)  
2) Admin → Decisions panel (toggle DRY_RUN per policy)  
3) Notion mirror for decision_policies (read-only sync)

Request:
Kick off with Step 1.1 — Leaderboard UI scaffold (Top performers this week + Dept rankings + My recent). Assume axios client exists.

Provide:
- Folder/file plan,
- Components to create,
- Exact code blocks,
- Success checks.
